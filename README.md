Hi I made this project during the 2 Days.
Also been used as Project#2 in Frontend Fundamentals course available on Pirple.com

I got to learn a lot from this basic Frontend Fundamentals Course by Pirple.com and it was an amazing experience learning with PIRPLE.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:

<li>HTML

<li>CSS
  
<li>JS  

<br>during this course everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.



I enjoyed attending this course, you can as well. Just visit: https://www.pirple.com/ and get register
